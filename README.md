# EulerChallenge
Repository for Euler challenge

Mathematician Euler has a set of 500 increasingly difficult math problems

I read some random article announcing the #ProjectEuler100 challenge

I'm taking on the #ProjectEuler100 challenge (privately (not announcing it over social media)) 
and this repository will contain all my code for completing these challenges
